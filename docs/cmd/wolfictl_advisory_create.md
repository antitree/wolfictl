## wolfictl advisory create

Create a new advisory

### Usage

```
wolfictl advisory create [flags]
```

### Synopsis

Create a new advisory.

Use this command to create a new advisory, i.e. when the given
package/vulnerability combination doesn't already exist in the advisories repo.
If the package/vulnerability combination already exists, use the "update"
command instead.

This command will prompt for all required fields, and will attempt to fill in
as many optional fields as possible. You can abort the advisory creation at any
point in the prompt by pressing Ctrl+C.

You can specify required values on the command line using the flags relevant to
the advisory you are creating. If not all required values are provided on the
command line, the command will prompt for the missing values.

If the --no-prompt flag is specified, then the command will fail if any
required fields are missing.

It's possible to create advisories for multiple packages and/or vulnerabilities 
at once by using a comma-separated list of package names and vulnerabilities. 
This is available for both the CLI flags and the interactive prompt fields.

This command also performs a follow-up operation to discover aliases for the
newly created advisory and any other advisories for the same package.
